/**
* Challenge: Fetch and map over the data to display it on
* the vans page. For an extra challenge, spend time styling
* it to look like the Figma design.
* 
* Hints:
* 1. Use `fetch("/api/vans")` to kick off the request to get the
*    data from our fake Mirage JS server
* 2. What React hook would you use to fetch data as soon as the
*    Vans page loads, and only fetch it the one time?
* 3. You may get an error saying "console.groupCollapsed is not
*    a function". You can ignore it for now.
